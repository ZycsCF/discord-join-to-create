Join To Create Source Code for discord.js v12

To start the bot, first use `npm i` in the folder where the source is located to install the packages needed.
Then in config.json add your bot's token, and the channel ID where you want the Join To Create Channel to be located.
Then use `node .` to start the bot, and the bot should run. Once you do that you're ready to go!
